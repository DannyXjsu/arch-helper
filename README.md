# arch-helper
this is just a script that helps me install arch linux a bit faster, it's not fancy or good but does the job

run the arch_helpher.sh first then the ah2.sh

run this after booting iso:

``curl -L https://github.com/DannyXjsu/arch-helper/archive/main.tar.gz``

if curl gets fucky with that command just add `--output [filename].tar.gz` at the end

run tar and then enter the folder and run the arch_helper.sh with bash
