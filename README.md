# arch-helper
this is just a script that helps me install arch linux a bit faster, it's not fancy or good but does the job

run ``arch_helpher.sh`` first then ``ah2.sh``, alternatively you could run ``arch_helper_full-sda.sh`` script to automate everything, but it will only use sda as the install device with only one partition, do not use this if you have precious data in your sda device

run this after booting iso:

``curl -L https://github.com/DannyXjsu/arch-helper/archive/main.tar.gz``

if curl gets fucky with that command just add `--output [filename].tar.gz` at the end

run tar and then enter the folder and run the arch_helper.sh with bash
